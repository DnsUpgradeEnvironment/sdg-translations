overview_blurb: 'In this overview, the ratings of the indicators are given according to the current year as well as the previous years. This shows whether the weather symbol for an indicator has been stable or rather volatile in the past years.<br><br>
  For indicators for which multiple targets are defined to be met over time (e.g., Indicator 7.1.b), the ratings for meeting each target are provided. The same applies to indicators that have several targets that are to be met at the same time (e.g. indicator 10.1).<br><br>
  In addition to the currently valid targets of the German Sustainability Strategy, targets are also shown that applied in the past but have been revised (and usually tightened) in the meantime.<br><br>
  All weather symbols for goals that are currently not valid because<br>
  • the target has been revised and tightened in the past,<br>
  • a target closer in time has to be fulfilled first, or<br>
  • the target is only one of several targets to be fulfilled at the same time<br>
  will only be displayed in grayed out form.<br>"
